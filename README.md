# Dart Empty List Error: Handling `last` Property

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: using the `last` property on an empty list. This action causes a runtime exception, resulting in unexpected program termination.

The `bug.dart` file shows the problematic code. The solution, in `bugSolution.dart`, demonstrates a robust way to access the last element while preventing such errors.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `bug.dart` using a Dart interpreter.
4. Observe the error.
5. Run `bugSolution.dart` to see how to avoid this error.
